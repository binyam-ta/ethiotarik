    "year": "100 CE - 940 CE",
    "description": "The Kingdom of Aksum was an ancient civilization centered in what is now Eritrea and northern Ethiopia. It was a major trading power in northeastern Africa, with its own currency and connections to the Mediterranean world, Arabia, and India. Aksum adopted Christianity in the 4th century, making it one of the first Christian kingdoms in the world.",
    "detailedInfo": "The Aksumite Empire was known for its impressive stone stelae, some standing over 30 meters tall. King Ezana's conversion to Christianity around 330 CE marked a turning point in Ethiopian history. Aksum's strategic location allowed it to control trade routes between Africa and Asia, dealing in ivory, gold, emeralds, and spices. The empire began to decline in the 7th-8th centuries due to climate change, shifting trade routes after the rise of Islam, and military pressures.",

    "detailedInfo": "The Zagwe dynasty originated from the Agaw people of the central highlands. King Lalibela, the dynasty's most famous ruler, is credited with the construction of 11 monolithic rock-hewn churches, carved from a single piece of rock. These architectural marvels were built as a 'New Jerusalem' after Muslim conquests made pilgrimages to the Holy Land difficult. The Zagwe period saw significant development in Ethiopian literature, art, and religious practices.",

    "detailedInfo": "The Solomonic dynasty claimed descent from King Solomon of Israel and the Queen of Sheba through their son Menelik I. This lineage was detailed in the Kebra Nagast ('Glory of Kings'), Ethiopia's national epic. Yekuno Amlak overthrew the last Zagwe king with support from the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. The restoration of the 'Solomonic' line was seen as a return to the legitimate rulers of Ethiopia and established a powerful connection between church and state that would define Ethiopian politics for centuries.",

His armies used firearms obtained from Ottoman allies, giving them a technological advantage. The conflict had religious dimensions, pitting the Christian highlands against Muslim lowlands. Emperor Lebna Dengel sought Portuguese assistance, and his son Gelawdewos, with Portuguese support, defeated Ahmad's forces at the Battle of Wayna Daga in 1543, where Ahmad was killed. The war severely weakened both Ethiopia and Adal, leaving them vulnerable to Oromo migrations that would reshape the region's demographics.",

The Gondarine period saw a flourishing of Ethiopian art, literature, and architecture, with influences from both local traditions and foreign contacts. The distinctive Gondarine style of painting emerged, characterized by bright colors and stylized figures. This era also saw increased contact with European powers, particularly Portugal, and renewed theological debates within the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. The annual Timkat (Epiphany) celebrations at Fasilides' Bath remain an important cultural tradition to this day.",

The emperor in Gondar retained religious significance but held little political power. During this period, Ethiopia was divided into several competing regions, including Shewa, Gojjam, Tigray, and Yejju. The Yejju Oromo dynasty of Ras Ali dominated the imperial court for much of this period. The fragmentation of power made Ethiopia vulnerable to external threats and hindered economic development. This chaotic period created the conditions for the rise of reformist leaders like Tewodros II, who sought to reunify and modernize the country.",

He aimed to modernize Ethiopia by creating a professional army, abolishing the slave trade, reforming taxation, and establishing a centralized government. Tewodros attempted to develop relations with European powers, particularly Britain, but was rebuffed. When British representatives failed to respond to his letters, he imprisoned several European missionaries and the British consul. This led to the 1868 British Expedition to Abyssinia, where British forces stormed his mountain fortress at Magdala. Rather than be captured, Tewodros committed suicide.

    "detailedInfo": "The Battle of Adwa resulted from Italy's attempt to establish a protectorate over Ethiopia through the deceptive Treaty of Wuchale, which contained different terms in its Italian and Amharic versions. Emperor Menelik II rejected the treaty and prepared for war. On March 1, 1896, Ethiopian forces of approximately 100,000, led by Emperor Menelik II and Empress Taytu Betul, decisively defeated the Italian army of about 20,000. The victory had profound implications, becoming a symbol of African resistance to European colonialism and inspiring anti-colonial movements across Africa and beyond. Ethiopia's success was due to effective leadership, numerical advantage, knowledge of the terrain, and the ability to obtain modern weapons. After Adwa, Italy recognized Ethiopia's independence in the Treaty of Addis Ababa.",

He introduced Ethiopia's first written constitution in 1931 and worked to modernize the country through educational reforms, infrastructure development, and centralization of power. When Italy invaded in 1935, he appealed to the League of Nations but received little support. His speech there warning that 'It is us today, it will be you tomorrow' proved prophetic. After exile in England during the Italian occupation (1936-1941), he returned with Allied support and continued reforms, including establishing Addis Ababa University and helping found the Organization of African Unity in 1963. Despite his international prestige, his rule became increasingly autocratic, and failure to address issues like land reform and famine led to his overthrow in 1974. For Rastafarians, he is considered a divine figure.",

Despite fierce Ethiopian resistance, Addis Ababa fell in May 1936, and Ethiopia was incorporated into Italian East Africa alongside Eritrea and Italian Somaliland.

Initially a coordinating committee of military officers, the Derg abolished the monarchy, nationalized land and industries, and aligned with the Soviet Union. Under Mengistu Haile Mariam's leadership, the regime became increasingly brutal, conducting the 'Red Terror' campaign (1977-1978) that killed thousands of suspected opponents. The Derg faced armed resistance from various ethnic-based movements, including the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). The 1984-1985 famine, exacerbated by civil war and forced resettlement policies, killed an estimated one million people. By 1991, with Soviet support gone and rebel forces advancing, the Derg collapsed and Mengistu fled to Zimbabwe.",

The 1995 constitution created an ethnic-based federal system dividing the country into regions based on major ethnic groups. Under Prime Minister Meles Zenawi (1995-2012), Ethiopia pursued a state-led development model that achieved impressive economic growth but limited political freedoms. Eritrea gained independence in 1993 after a referendum, but border disputes led to a devastating war (1998-2000). After Meles' death, Hailemariam Desalegn became prime minister until resigning amid protests in 2018. His successor, Abiy Ahmed, initially introduced sweeping reforms, releasing political prisoners, making peace with Eritrea (earning him the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize), and promising free elections. However, ethnic tensions increased, and in 2020 conflict erupted in the Tigray Region, developing into a civil war with severe humanitarian consequences.

It began with the introduction of rinderpest (cattle plague) from infected Indian cattle imported by Italian forces in Eritrea. The disease decimated Ethiopia's cattle population, destroying both a food source and the oxen needed for plowing. This was compounded by drought and locust swarms that destroyed crops. The resulting famine killed an estimated one-third of Ethiopia's population. The disaster weakened Ethiopia just before the Battle of Adwa, making Menelik II's victory over the Italians even more remarkable.
